        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A hamburger is a classic American dish that consists of a ground beef patty, typically grilled or fried, and served on a bun with a variety of toppings. Common toppings include lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, cheese, bacon, ketchup, mustard, and mayonnaise. The hamburger patty is usually seasoned with salt and pepper and can be cooked to different levels of doneness, such as rare, medium, or well-done. Hamburger dishes can be customized to fit a variety of tastes and preferences, and are often served alongside french fries or other sides.</p>

        <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound ground beef (80% lean, 20% fat)</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
            <li>4 hamburger buns</li>
            <li>Toppings of your choice (lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, cheese, etc.)</li>       
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat a grill, grill pan, or skillet to medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Divide the ground beef into four equal portions and form them into patties that are slightly wider than the hamburger buns. Press down the center of each patty with your thumb to create a slight indentation (this will help the burgers cook evenly).</li>
            <li>Season both sides of each patty generously with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Place the patties on the grill or in the skillet and cook for 3-4 minutes on the first side. Flip the patties over and cook for an additional 3-4 minutes on the second side, or until the internal temperature reaches 160°F (71°C).</li>
            <li>While the patties are cooking, prepare the hamburger buns and toppings. Toast the buns on the grill or in a toaster, and slice the toppings as desired.</li>
            <li>Assemble the burgers by placing the cooked patties on the bottom buns, and adding the toppings of your choice.</li>
            <li>Top the burgers with the remaining bun halves and serve immediately. Enjoy!</li>
