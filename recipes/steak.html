        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A steak is a cut of beef that is typically served grilled or pan-seared, and is often considered a luxury dish due to its high quality and rich flavor. The most popular steak cuts include ribeye, sirloin, filet mignon, and T-bone. Steaks can be prepared in a variety of ways, ranging from rare to well-done, and can be seasoned with a variety of herbs and spices to enhance the natural flavor of the meat. A steak dish is often served alongside a variety of sides, such as roasted vegetables, mashed potatoes, or a salad. A well-prepared steak is a satisfying and hearty meal that can be enjoyed on special occasions or as a special treat.</p>

        <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 steak (ribeye, sirloin, filet mignon, or T-bone)</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
            <li>Olive oil or butter</li>  
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Remove the steak from the fridge and let it come to room temperature for 30-60 minutes before cooking.</li>
            <li>Preheat a grill, grill pan, or skillet to high heat.</li>
            <li>Season the steak generously with salt and pepper on both sides.</li>
            <li>Rub the steak with a small amount of olive oil or butter to prevent sticking and add flavor.</li>
            <li>Place the steak on the grill or in the skillet and cook for 3-4 minutes on one side.</li>
            <li>Flip the steak over and cook for an additional 3-4 minutes on the other side.</li>
            <li>Check the internal temperature of the steak using a meat thermometer. For medium-rare, the temperature should be 135°F (57°C); for medium, the temperature should be 145°F (63°C); for well-done, the temperature should be 160°F (71°C).</li>
            <li>Remove the steak from the grill or skillet and let it rest for 5-10 minutes to allow the juices to redistribute.</li>
            <li>Slice the steak against the grain into thin strips, and serve immediately with your choice of sides. Enjoy!</li>
